During the last year, the COVID-19 enabled us to understand the positives and negatives of remote working, leveraging technology to understand what work is better done remotely and what work is better done face to face. Our people are provided with the tools to work remotely and we are now assessing how to develop a hybrid model which enables our people to retain the positive elements that they have enjoyed from remote working blended with the in-person collaboration, which we recognise is both critical and fulfilling.</p>

Throughout the pandemic, senior leaders across the business have had regular interaction with all team members and colleagues have been encouraged to check in with each other on an ongoing basis. In addition to this, we have also offered our team members access to professional support, as needed, from our private medical insurance providers.</p>

           <p class="text-xl leading-8">We are aware of the positive influence that Syncona can have within the UK life sciences industry in driving positive action to increase diversity within the sector. The underrepresentation of ethnic minorities within Science, Technology, Engineering and Maths (STEM) careers in the UK is striking and it is also a pertinent issue in the venture capital space.

Specifically, we have recognised that research consistently highlights black minorities as being the least represented within STEM and Venture Capital and our desire to combat this trend is reflected in our choice of charitable partners.

Our diversity and inclusion (D&I) approach aims to target the underrepresentation of minorities within life sciences, through partnering with organisations who provide pathways at school, undergraduate and postgraduate level. Ultimately, our aim is to implement a long-term programme which can guide young people through their education and into a possible future career as life science investors.

In doing so, we aim to expose those involved in the programmes to many of the values which drive performance at Syncona, as we aim to build the next generation of data driven, entrepreneurial leaders in life sciences investment.

We actively encourage our employees to participate in our partnership schemes, either as advocates, mentors or buddies, with our D&I strategy also aligned with the goals of the</p>
